# Autumn's gentle guide to Java

Hi!

This project is a gift to my past self. When I was struggling to learn to code in 2020, I needed reference material written plainly, with code examples and practice suitable for a beginner. I hope that by writing what would have helped me, it can be useful to someone else.

Don't expect any optimized code, even the tests and supporting files are purposefully basic and grouped by topic. Eveyrthing is here for learning through play and exploration.

I know I needed to hear this when I was a beginner: be kind to yourself. Stress and self-doubt inhibit your learning. Slow down, get comfortable, and chill a little :) This guide isn't here to be a challenge, it's just some relaxed review and practice.

Much love,
