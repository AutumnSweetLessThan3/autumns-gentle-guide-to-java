## Plan

My overall project goal is to make a review and reference sheet written for developers
who need to review and practice, focusing on readability for inexperienced coders and
approaching the process from a place of humility and peace on my part.

I'm making this guide using a super basic version of the agile method, setting small
goals based on what the next best MVP is. 

I want this part to be accessible too, in case it may help someone else with their
own projects, so I'll be putting a little 'backstage' section into the project
containing all this planning and organizing. 

I'm going to use this document to lay out 
some iterations, and try to make my notes as self-descriptive as possible:
```
#### Iteration 1

```http
  mvp: project skeleton
```

| done? | task     | notes                       |
| :-------- | :------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `✓`      | **create PLAN.md** |  |
| `✓`      | **create backstage folder in project** |  |
| `✓`      | **make template topic package** | |
| `✓`      | **make template info file** | named after the topic it's housed in |
| `✓`      | **make template example package** |  |
| `✓`      | **make template practice package** |  |
| `✓`      | **populate placeholder files** |  |
| ` `      | **get new github token to push to new account** | why does this always feel confusing to do? |

#### Iteration 2

```http
  mvp: implement first topic to work out kinks
```

| done? | task     | notes                       |
| :-------- | :------- | :-------------------------------- |
| ` `      | **create guides.variables topic** | based on template |
| ` `      | **create guides.variables example** |  |
| ` `      | **create guides.variables practice tests** | |
| ` `      | **create guides.variables practice solution** |  |
| ` `      | **create guides.variables practice file** | |
| ` `      | **set necessary files to read-only** |  |


#### Iteration 3

```http
  mvp: more guides! First focus on list of 'problem' guides 
```

| done? | topic     | notes                       |
| :-------- | :------- | :-------------------------------- |
| ` `      | **methods** | static, normal, declaring, utilizing |
| ` `      | **entities** | class + abstract, interface + functional |
| ` `      | **overriding/overloading** | |
| ` `      | **recursion** |  |
